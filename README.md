# socket-chat-godot

This is an example Godot + NodeJS chat application to demonstrate using nodeJS servers with a godot-based client.

### To start the server:

`cd server && npm install && npm start`

### Running the game
Use the Godot editor to import the project (in `/client`). 
To test more than one user, you can run multiple instances of the game by clicking Run multiple times in the Project List.
